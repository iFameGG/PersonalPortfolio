# Personal Portfolio

## Goal
Learn the Django web framework to have it as a asset, when deploying future projects. Also, I mainly want a website where I can display past and future projects. In addition, it will allow me to aggregate information about myself (outside of linkedin).

## Methodology 
1. Build a simple portfolio using the Django Framework
    <br>a. Have a main scrollable page with projects, about me section and contact info
    <br>b. Individual pages for each project and use a database to store project info and build pages dynamically
    <br>c. Create page for my resume

2. Deploy using Railway, since compute it is a cheap way to host the website
    <br>a. Host PostgreSQL database
    <br>b. Connect Repo to the railway project
    <br>c. Automatically deploy when a commit happens
